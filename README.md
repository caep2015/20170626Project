##TIY Basic Computer and Termial Skills Week 1 

## Pushing to GitHub
In this project you'll create a few local files, make changes to them and push them to GitHub.

##Step 1  
The first thing you need to do is create a project folder somewhere on your computer. You should probably keep all of your projects together, but it's up to you where you put them.
You can either use the Finder or Terminal to create a new folder, though at this point we would suggest using Terminal. Once that is complete, navigate in your terminal to that project and continue on to the next step.

##Step 2  
Now that you've got a project on your computer, head over to GitHub and create a new repository for you to push your code to.

##Step 3  
Initialize Git in this folder
Connect this local project to your GitHub project
Create a file called README.md
Open this file in your text editor and add some text in it.
This content can be anything, even some Lorem Ipsum
Add, Commit and Push this to GitHub.
Make sure your first commit message is simply initial commit
Before moving on, make sure the text you wrote is showing up on GitHub in your repository.

##Step 4  
Create another file LICENSE.md
Open this file in your text editor and add some text in it.
For instance you could add Copyright (c) Your Name
Add, Commit and Push this to GitHub.
Since this isn't your first commit message, please describe what you are doing.

##Conclusion  
Once you've done the above you should see a repository containing 2 files with 2 commits on GitHub.
You should also be able to run git status on your local project and see the response nothing to commit, working directory clean. This means all the work you've done locally is up on GitHub.
